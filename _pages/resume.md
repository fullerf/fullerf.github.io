## Technical Skills

|Skill                                       |Examples               |
|---|---|
|High Performance Parallel Computing| I have used DASK, mpi4py, and tensorflow.distribute along with queue systems like SLURM and LSF to write distributed analysis code to process X-ray data at XFEL facilities like LCLS and SACLA, using multiple (10s) CPUs and GPUs|
|Streaming Big Data Analysis | Rapid access to experimental data at XFEL facilities is available to sample data before it is written to intermediate disk storage. I used existing python-based infrastructure to monitor experimental data as it was being collected and designed a variational model specifically to update signal estimates from streamed data.|
|Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms| I have written and customized Gaussian Process libraries and Neural Network libraries to process X-ray spectroscopic data using mainly pytorch and Tensorflow. I keep a close eye on the literature relating to variational models for continuous, high dimensional data. |
|Non-linear parametric optimization | In matlab, julia, and python I have made extensive use of gradient based non-linear fitting with gradients supplied by automatic differentiation or hand-built to recover useful parameters in physically inspired models, such as time decay analysis, fitting of geometry parameters in calibration, and small scale maximum likelihood signal estimation.|
|Simuation| I calibrate expectations and diagnoise model deficiencies by training models I intend to employ on real data by first studying them on detailed physical simulations of the problem domain.|
|Data Munging| I work mainly with sensor (float or integer valued) data, but these come in a variety of formats and datasets need to be filtered according to experimental condition as well as be stripped of outliers detected via a variety of disparate beam and acclerator diagnostics|
|Statistical Modeling| I mainly use variational approximations to estimate the marginal likelihood of the data via minimization of the evidence lower bound. This is a class of model useful to provide uncertain quantification for intermediate to large scale datasets.|

## Leadership Experience

|Skill                                       |Examples               |
|---|---|
|Postdoctoral Researcher Mentorship| I have mentored two researchers (Anton Loukianov and Chantal Mustoe), teaching both mathematical underpinnings for Machine Learning methods as well as working with them to develop software implementations for these methods so they can be applied to experimental data. Both have used these experiences to go into Data Science careers now.|
|Undergradaute Mentorship | Through the Linac Coherent Light Source summer internship program, I mentored two undergraduate researchers, which involved planning an 10 week project to train them in applied data analysis, teaching both python-based analysis (mainly using numpy and pytorch) as well as mathematical modeling. |
|Collaborative Mentorship| I maintain close ties with my former group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, providing training to new postdoctoral researchers and graduate students on the instrumention I developed there and guidance in developing related instrumentation.|
|Proposal reviews commitees| I have served on research proposal review committees for SLAC, National Institue of Health, and the Department of Energy, where my role was to assess the quality of the proposed research plans.
