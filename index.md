I am currently working at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, CA, as an Associate Scientist, since November 2017. I investigate chemical reactions using X-ray spectroscopy and design new experimental and analysis techniques to better utilize the unique properties of the X-ray Free Electron laser at SLAC.

I am passionate about building tools, be they software or experimental, to push the envelope of what is possible and eagerly learned new skills to tackle these problems. I have for a long time had a passion for applying mathematical models to real world problems, be it optical femtosecond laser systems, hard X-ray instrumentation, time series or spectroscopic data. In my current position, I am applying machine learning techniques (Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks) to address the challenge of using an unstable X-ray source to make high precision measurements. Check out [my most recent publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42004-021-00512-3) to see some concrete progress on that front.
